# Preface {-}

This book was written for the Collecting and Analyzing Data class (QMGT-4750) taught in Millsaps College, Jackson, Mississippi, USA. I took this class as a freshman in the 2020 spring semester and I am writing this book as a way to improve my R knowledge and keep myself busy during summer break and the COVID-19 global pandemic. This book was written using **R Markdown** [@R-rmarkdown] and **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown]. 

Bookdown is an extremely versatile package and it has been really fun learning process. *Bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown* [@bookdown2016] has been my guide for the **bookdown** package. I recommend anyone who is interested in this package to check it out.



```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'tidyverse'
), 'packages.bib')
```
